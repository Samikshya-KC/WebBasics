    <h2>Welcome to day 8 of learning</h2>
    <p>Here we discuss about OOP.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First of all we make a new file with the name of 'Room.cs' in ConsoleApp directory.In this we define some fields:</li>
        <pre>
            <code>
    public class Room
    {
    public double widthFt;
    public double lengthFt;
    public double heightFt;
    public string paintColor;
    public byte floor;
    }
</code>
        </pre>
        <li>Then in another file 'Program.cs' we make new method() to call 'Room' fieldset.</li>
        <pre>
            var r1=new Room();
            r1.paintColor="Red";
            r1.floor=3;
            r1.lengthFt=15.5;
            r1.widthFt=12.4;
            r1.heightFt=8;
            var info = $"Hey guys,we have a room in a floor {r1.floor} which is painted {r1.paintColor}. It's dimension is {r1.lengthFt}X{r1.widthFt}X{r1.heightFt}";
            Console.WriteLine(info);
        </pre>
        <li>There is another way to call its field by using parameterized constructor.Inside the 'Room'class we have to pass argument in constructor in 'Room.cs' file:</li>
        <pre>
            public Room(string c,byte f,double l,double w,double h){
                paintColor=c;
                floor=f;
                lengthFt=l;
                widthFt=f;
                heightFt=h;
            }
        
        </pre>
        <li>Then we are allowed to pass the value directly in the argument as shown below.</li>
        <pre>
        var r2=new Room("Pink",4,13.5,12.9,8);
        </pre>
        <li>To display above code we have to make new method to call this information in 'Room.cs':</li>
        <pre>
            public void DisplayInfo()
            {
                var info = $"Hey guys,we have a room in a floor {floor} which is painted {paintColor}. It's dimension is {lengthFt}X{widthFt}X{heightFt}";
                Console.WriteLine(info);
            }
           
        </pre>
        <li>Then we call this method from 'Program.cs'</li>
        <pre>
        var r2=new Room("Pink",4,13.5,12.9,8);
        r2.DisplayInfo();
        </pre>
        <li>We also inherit the features of one class from another class.Here we inherit the features of 'Room' for 'HotelRoom'.So, make another class with name 'HotelRoom.cs'.</li>
        <pre>
            public class HotelRoom:Room{
            }
        </pre>
        <li>To enable this inherit features we have to add default constructor in 'Room.cs' within the class.</li>
        <pre>
            public Room(){

            }
        </pre>
        <li>'HotelRoom' class can have additional features,so we can add additional fields  in it.</li>
        <pre>
            public class HotelRoom:Room{
                public byte beds;
                public bool hasAC;
                public bool attachedWashroom;
            }
        </pre>
    </ul>
