    <h2>Welcome to Day 3 </h2>
    <p>Here we dissuss about bootstrap and its uses.</p>
    <h2>What is Bootstrap?</h2>
    <p>Bootstrap is a powerful tool in web development,widely used to create responsive and visually appealing websites.It provides a grid system that allows developers to create layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes,from mobile devices to large desktop monitors.It comes with a library of pre-built components like navigation bars,buttons,modals,forms and alerts which can be easily integrated into a web page.Developers can quickly include bootstrap in their projects by linking to the CSS and JavaScript files from a CDN(Content Delivery Network)or downloading the files locally.</p>
    <h2>Why bootstrap was introduced?</h2>
    <p>Bootstrap was introduced to simplify and standardize the process of web development.Initially created by Twitter developers Mark Otto and Jacob 
    Thornton,it was designed to address the following key challenges:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Before Bootstrap, developers faced design and functionality inconsistencies across projects.Bootstrap introduced a unified framework that ensured consistent and cohesive designs.</li>
        <li>As multi-device access grew,responsive designs became vital.Bootstrap's grid system and tools allowed developers to create layouts that adapted effortlessly to various screen sizes.</li>
        <li>By offering pre-built components,bootstrap saved developers significant time. Instead of building everything from scratch,they could reuse and adapt these components.</li>
        <li>Ensuring compatibility across multiple browser used to be difficult task. Bootstrap makes it easier for developers to create websites that worked well everywhere.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want to use bootstrap in your HTML file.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First you have to add bootstrap to your project by linking its CDN in the &lt;head&gt; of your HTML:</li>
        <img src="../EachDay/Images/img14.png"/>
        <li>Then,you can use it by using their pre-built components.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Embed the College.html file -->
    <iframe src="../College.html" width="500" height="400" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    <p>Here we build registration form</p>
     <!-- Embed the Register.html file -->
    <iframe src="../Register.html" width="500" height="400" style="border:none;"></iframe>
